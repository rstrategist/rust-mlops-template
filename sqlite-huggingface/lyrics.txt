Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me?
All in all, it was just a brick in the wall
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall
Hey!
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
We don't need no education
Wе don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, lеave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
Wrong, do it again!
Wrong, do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
Wrong, do it again!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
Wrong, do it again!
You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!
